Data Types
==========
This library's comments uses names of data types differently from standart JS

Basic data types
----------------

  Undefined        = undefined value
  Void / Null      = null value
  Boolean          = True / False
  String           = simple string created by '' or ""
  Integer          = simple integer value (e.g. 1, 5, 123, 0xFF)
  Float / Double   = simple float value (1.5, 3.0, .5)
  Object           = object created by {} parenthesis (any but Array!!!)
  Array            = object creared by [] parenthesis

Note that any values are not created by constructors!!!
e.g. Array !== new Array()

Advanced data types
-------------------

  DOMelement       = element of DOM created by document.createElement()
  Element          = element created by $.element()
  Event            = instance of $.event class
  
OOP terms
---------

  class            = function that is marked as @constructor
                     use "new class()" to create instance
  instance         = object that was created by "new class()"
  wrapper          = function that creates new object to wrap the given one
                     use "wrapper(object)" to create the wrapper
                     you don't have to use "new" keyword when creating wrapper
